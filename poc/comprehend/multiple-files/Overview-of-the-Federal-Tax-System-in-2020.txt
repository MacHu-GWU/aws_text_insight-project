          Overview of  the  Federal  Tax Sys tern in 2020 


Summary
This report describes the federal tax structure and system in effect for 2020. The report also 
provides selected statistics on the tax system as a whole. Historically, the largest component of 
the federal tax system, in terms of revenue generated, has been the individual income tax. For 
FY2020, an estimated $1.5 trillion,  or 47% of the federal government's revenue, will be collected 
from the individual  income tax. The corporate income tax is estimated to generate another $151 
billion  in revenue in  FY2020, or approximately 5% of total revenue. Social insurance or payroll 
taxes will generate an estimated $1.3 trillion,  or 36% of revenue in FY2020. For 2019, it was 
estimated that revenues will be 16.3% of gross domestic product (GDP), shghtly below the post- 
World War II average of 17.2% of GDP.
The largest source of revenue for the federal government is the individual income tax. The federal 
individual  income tax is levied  on an individual's  taxable income, which is adjusted gross 
income (AGI) less deductions. Tax rates based on filing status (e. g., married filing jointly,  
head of household, or single individual)  determine the amount of tax liability.  Income tax rates 
in the United  States are generally progressive, such that higher leveb of income are typically  
taxed at higher rates. Once tentative tax liability  is calculated, tax credits can be used to 
reduce tax  hability.  Tax deductions and tax credits are tools available to policymakers  to 
increase or decrease the after-tax price of undertaking specific activities. Individuals with high 
levels  of deductions  and credits relative to income may be required to pay the alternative 
minimum tax (AMT).
The federal government also levies  taxes on corporations, wage earnings, and certain other goods. 
Corporate taxable income is subject to tax at a flat rate of 21%. Social Security and Medicare tax 
rates are, respectively, 12.4% and 2.9% of earnings. In 2020, Social Security taxes are levied on 
the first $137,700 of wages. Medicare taxes are assessed against all wage income. Federal excise 
taxes are levied  on specific goods, such as transportation fuels, alcohol, and tobacco.
Looking at the tax system as a whole, several observations can be made. Notably, the composition of 
revenues has changed over time. Corporate income tax revenues have become a smaller share of 
overall tax revenues over time, while social insurance revenues have trended upward as a share of 
total revenues. Social insurance revenues are a sizable component of the overall federal tax 
system. Most taxpayers pay more in payroll taxes than income taxes. Many taxpayers pay social 
insurance taxes but do not pay individual  income taxes, having incomes below the amount that would 
generate a positive income tax liability.  From an international  perspective, the U.S. federal tax 
system tends to collect less in federal revenues as a percentage of GDP than other OECD countries.

                Overview of  the   Federal  Tax Sys tern in 2020 



he U.S. federal tax system includes several elements. Income taxes are the primary component, and 
the United States has an income tax that applies  to the income of individuals  and a separate 
income tax for corporations.  Payroll taxes are levied on earned
income, with most of this revenue used to finance social insurance programs. The U.S. tax system
also includes an estate and gift tax, as well as various excise taxes.
At the end of 2017, President Trump signed into law P.L. 115-97, which substantially changed the
U.S. federal tax system. Consequently, the federal tax system in effect for 2020 differs from what 
was in effect for 2017.' Most of the changes to the individual income tax system in P.L. 115-97 are 
temporary and scheduled to expire at the end of 2025. Thus, under current law, after 2025, the 
individual  income tax system is slated to look like  the system that was in effect for 2017. In 
contrast, many of the changes made in P.L. 115-97 affecting corporations  are permanent.
This report provides an overview of the federal tax system, including the individual  income tax, 
corporate income tax, payroll taxes, estate and gift taxes, and federal excise taxes, as in effect 
for 2020. Information on changes to the tax system enacted in the 2017 tax revision (P.L. 115-97) 
can be found in CRS Report R45092, The 2017 Tax Revision (P.L. 115-97).’  Comparison to 2017 Tax 
Law, coordinated by Molly F. Sherlock and Donald J. Marples.

The Federal Income Tax System
The federal income tax system has several components. The largest component, in terms of revenue 
generated, is the individual  income tax. In FY2019, the individual  income tax generated
$1.7 trillion  in federal revenue (Figure 1). The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has projected 
that federal income tax revenues in FY2020 will be $1.5 trillion,  with the decline due to the 
economic effects of and policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 2  In FY2019, nearly 50% of 
federal revenue came from the individual  income tax. In FY2020, it is projected that about 47% of 
federal revenue will be generated through the individual  income tax. Similar  to the individual 
income tax, corporate tax revenues are expected to decline in FY2020, relative  to FY2019 levels. 
In FY2019, corporate tax receipts were $230 billion, or nearly 7% of federal revenue. In FY2020, 
corporate tax receipts are expected to be $151 billion,  less than 5% of federal revenue.
The second-largest source of federal revenue is payroll taxes. In FY2019, payroll taxes generated
$1.2 trillion  in  federal revenue (36% of the total revenue). This figure is projected to increase 
in FY2020, to $1.3 trillion  (40% of total revenue). Receipts from other sources are also projected 
to increase in FY2020 to $298 billion,  from $271 billion  in  FY2019 (rising to 9% of total 
revenue from 8%).



'  See  CRS  Report R45053, The Federal Tax Sy.stem for the 2017 Tax Year, by Molly F. Sherlock  
and Donald J. Marples.
2 Before the COVID- 19 pandemic,  the Office of Management  and Budget  estimated that for FY2020, 
approximately
$1 .8 trillion, or 49% of the federal government's revenue, would  come from the individual  income 
tax. It was estimated the corporate income tax would generate another $264 billion in revenue in 
FY2020, or just  over 7% of total revenue. Social  insurance or payroll taxes were expected 
generate an estimated $1.3 trillion, or 35% of revenue in FY2020.
Estimates indicate that the remainder of federal revenue collected in FY2020 was  expected to come 
from excise taxes (3%) or other sources (6%). Other sources include  estate and gift  taxes, 
customs duties and fees, and deposits of earnings by  the Federal  Reserve System.  Historical data 
on federal receipts by source can be  found in T able  2.1 of the Historical Tables published  by  
the Office of Management and Budget   (OM B), available  at

Notes:  CBO's  pr  iections   of FY2020 revenues  are  based  on  federal  receipts  through july 
2020. Other receipts include excise  taxes, Federal  Reserve  deposits,  customs  duties,  estate 
and gift taxes, and miscellaneous   fees.

The  Individual Income Tax
The individual  income tax is the largest source of revenue in the federal income tax system. Most 
of the income reported on individual  income tax returns is wages and salaries. CBO projects that 
in 2020, 64% of total income reported on individual  income tax returns will be from salaries and 
wages.4 Asubstantial portion of business income in the United  States is taxed in the individual 
income tax system. Pass-through businesses, including sole proprietorships, partnerships, S 
corporations,  and limited liability  companies, generally pass business income through to the 
business’s owners, where that income is taxed at individual income tax rates. 5  Projections 
indicated that in 2020, 9% of total income reported by individual  taxpayers would be net business 
income, including  pass-through business income, farm, or Schedule E income. 6 Another 13% of 
taxable income is retirement-related, in the form of taxable pensions, annuities, IRAdistributions 
or taxable Social Security Benefits. 7

Gross Income and Adjustments
To levy an income tax, income must first be defined. As a benchmark, economists often turn to the 
Haig-Simons  comprehensive income definition, which can differ from the measure of income used in 
computing a taxpayer's taxes. Under the Haig-Simons definition,  taxable resources are defined as 
changes in a taxpayer's ability to consume during the tax year.   Using this definition  of income, 
an employer's contributions  toward employee health insurance, for example, would be counted toward 
the employee's income. This income, however, is not included in the employee's taxable income under 
current tax law.
In practice, the individual  income tax is based on gross income individuals  accrue from a variety 
of sources. Included in the individual  income tax base are wages, salaries, tips, taxable interest 
and dividend  income, business and farm income, realized net capital gains, income from rents, 
royalties, trusts, estates, partnerships, and taxable pension and annuity income.
Gross income for tax purposes excludes certain items, which may deviate from the Haig- Simmons 
definition  of income. For example, employer-provided health insurance, pension contributions, and 
certain other employee benefits are excluded from income subject to tax. 9 Employer  contributions  
to Social Security are also excluded from wages. Amounts received under life insurance contracts 
are excluded from income. Another exclusion from income is the interest received on certain state 
and local bonds.10 Some forgiven debts and various other items are also excluded from income for 
tax purposes.''
There are special rules for income earned as capital gains or dividends.12  Capital gains (or 
losses) are realized  when assets are sold.'   The tax base excludes unrealized capital gains.'4  
There are reduced tax rates for certain capital gains and dividends  (discussed below in the “Tax 
Rates” section).15 As with ordinary income, there may be exclusions. For example, certain capital 
gains on sales of primary residences are excluded from income.
Income from operating a business through a proprietorship, partnership, or small business 
corporation that elects to be treated similarly to a partnership (Subchapter S corporation),  or 
income from rental property, is also subject to the individual  income tax. '6 This income is the 
net


T he Haig-Simons comprehensive income definition was first developed  in Robert Murray  Haig, “T he 
Concept of Income—Economic and Legal Aspects,” in  The Federal Incom e Tax, ed. Robert Murray  Haig 
(New York, NY: Columbia  University Press, 1921), pp. 1 -28; and Henry C. Simons,  Personal Incom e 
Taxation.’  The Defin ition of
Incam e as a Pro blem a[Fiscal Policy (Chicago,  IL: University of Chicago  Press, 1938). An 
overview of the concept can be  found in Jonathan Gruber,  Public Finance and Putt lie Poliey, 2‘ᵈ 
ed. (New York, NY: Worth Publishers, 2007).
Exclusions are a form of “tax expenditure.” T ax expenditures are revenue losses associated with  
targeted provisions that move the income tax away from a “theoretical normal” tax system.

up to $3,000 of capital losses from ordinary income per tax year (the deduction is limited to 
$1,500 for married taxpayers filing separately).

of gross receipts reduced by such deductible costs as payments to labor, depreciation, costs of 
goods acquired for resale and other inputs, interest, and taxes.
A taxpayer's adjusted gross income (AGI), the basic measure of income under the federal income tax, 
is determined  by subtracting “above-the-line” deductions from gross income.17 Above-the- line 
deductions are avaihble  to taxpayers regardless of whether they itemize deductions  or claim the 
standard deduction. Above-the-line deductions may be claimed for, among other items, contributions 
to qualified retirement plans by self-employed individuals,  contributions  to individual  
retirement accounts (IRAs),'8  interest paid on student loans, higher education tuition expenses, 
and contributions  to health savings accounts.'9 Temporarily,  in 2020, there is a $300 
above-the-line deduction for charitable contributions. 2

Filing Status and Deductions
Tax liability  depends on the filing  status of the taxpayer. There are four main filing 
categories: married filing  jointly,  married filing  separately, head of household, and single 
individual.  The computation of taxpayers' tax liability  depends on their filing  status, as 
discussed further below. The amount of the standard deduction also depends on filing status. 
Deductions are subtracted before determining taxable  income.
Taxpayers have a choice between claiming the standard deduction or claiming the sum of their 
itemized  deductions. The standard deduction amount depends on filing status. The 2020 standard 
deduction for single filers is $12,400, while the standard deduction for married taxpayers filing 
jointly  is twice that amount, or $24,800. The standard deduction for a head of household is
$18,650. There is an additional standard deduction for the elderly (taxpayers age 65 and older) and 
the blind.2' The standard deduction amount is indexed for inflation. 22
When the sum of taxpayers' itemized deductions exceeds the standard deduction, taxpayers may choose 
to itemize. Deductions may be allowed for mortgage interest2'  and charitable contributions.24  
Taxpayers may also claim up to $10,000 ($5,000 for married taxpayers filing separately) in total 
deductions for state and local taxes (income, sales, or property taxes). 25

TCJA Changes in Personal Exemptions and Deductions
The 20 17 Tax  Revision  (P.L  115 -97) substantially changed the individual income  tax  system  
by eliminating personal  exemptions  and nearly doubling  the standard deduction.
Before  20 18, taxpayers deducted personal  exemptions  from  their AGI  when  calculating taxable 
income.  Personal exemptions  were  allowed  for  taxpayers, their  spouse,  and any dependents.  
For  20 20, the personal  exemption amount would have been  $4,3 00 per  exemption,  had the  
exemption  not  been temporarily  eliminated  in  P.L  I I S - 97.
Standard deduction  amounts  for 20 18 would  have been  $6,500  for single  filers,   and $13,000 
for  married taxpayers  filing  i   intly,  had P.L.   1  15 -97  not been enacted.  Nearly  
doubling the standard deduction  meant  that fewer  taxpayers itemized  deductions. Additional  
limitations  imp osed  on  the deduction for  state and local  taxes
and moKgage  interest  deduction in  P.L.   I I 5-97 may have also  contributed  to fewer  
taxpayers  claiming  these deductions.
The  share  of taxpayers  itemizing  deductions fell  substantially  between  20 17 and 20 18, with 
lower  itemization rates  continuing in  20  19 (see  Figure  2).For 2017, the joint  Committee   
on Taxation  (jCT) estimated  that 48.7 million   (3 2%) tax  filers  would  itemize  deductions.  
For  20 19, the JCT  estimated   that  I 7.9 million   ( I I %) tax  filers would  itemize  
deductions.

Some deductions can only be itemized  and claimed in excess of a floor. For example, medical 
expenses can be deducted to the extent they exceed 7.5% of AGI.°6 Casualty and theft losses 
attributable to federally declared disasters can also be deducted in excess of 10% of AGI. 27


26 T he Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster T ax Relief Act of 201 9, enacted as Division  Q of the 
Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (P.L. 11 6-94), lowered the  floor from 10% to 7.5% 
for all taxpayers for 2019 and 2020. After 2020, under current  law, the  floor is scheduled  to 
increase  to 10% of AGI  for  all t axpayers, but may be extended as part of “tax ext enders.”
2’ T he Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster T ax Relief Act of 2019 (P.L. 116-94, Division Q) modified 
the casualty  loss deduction  for losses  attributable to 2018 or 2019 disasters. The  
modifications (1) waived the 1 0% of AGI  floor; (2) increased the $100 floor for each casualty to 
$500; and (3) allowed  taxpayers not itemizing deductions to add  the deduction  to their standard 
deduction.  See  CRS  Report R45864, Tax Policy and Disaster  Reco very, by  Molly  F. Sherlock  
and Jennifer T eefy.

Deduction  for Qualified  Business  Income
The deduction for qualified business income is also taken in determining  taxable income. 2 
Individual taxpayers can deduct 20% of qualified business income from a partnership, S corporation, 
or sole proprietorship. Individual taxpayers can also deduct 20% of qualified Real Estate 
Investment Trust (REIT) dividends, publicly traded partnership income, and cooperative dividends. 
For certain taxpayers, the deduction is subject to two limitations. First, above threshold amounts, 
the deduction begins to phase out for income from certain services, including health, law, 
accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, consulting, athletics, financial services, 
brokerage services, or investing and investments management services. These threshold amounts are 
$315,000 for married taxpayers filing joint  returns (adjusted for inflation to $326,600 in 2020), 
and $157,500 for all other taxpayers (adjusted for inflation to $163,300 in 2020). Second, the 
deduction is also subject to limitation  based on the taxpayer's share of wages paid and 
depreciable assets of the associated business. Specifically, the deduction is limited to the 
greater of 50% of W-2 wages, or 25% of W-2 wages plus 2.5% of the cost of qualified property. This 
second limitation  phases in over the same thresholds as the fast limitation.

Tax Rates
The income tax system is designed to be progressive, with statutory marginal tax rates increasing 
as income increases.29 At a particular statutory marginal tax rate, all individuals  subject to the 
regular income tax, regardless of their overall level of earnings, pay the same tax rate on taxable 
income within the bracket.'0 Once taxpayers' incomes surpass a threshold level placing them in a 
higher marginal tax bracket, the higher marginal tax rate is only applied  on income that exceeds 
that threshold value. In 2020, the individual  income tax system has seven marginal income tax 
rates: 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%.31  These marginal income tax rates are apphed to 
taxable income to arrive at a taxpayer's gross income tax liability. 32  Threshold levels 
associated with the rate brackets depend on filing status. Tax rates for 2020 are summarized in 
Table 1.
For most taxpayers, their average tax rate (individual income taxes paid divided  by income) is 
less than their statutory tax rate. This is due to the progressive nature of the tax system, 
coupled with a variety of tax preference items (credits, deductions, exclusions, etc.). Many 
taxpayers, particularly lower-income taxpayers, have negative average tax rates. Refundable tax 
credits, such as the earned income tax credit (EITC) (discussed below), can lead to negative 
average tax rates.

32 T ake, for example, a single taxpayer with taxable income of $50,000. T hat taxpayer would fall 
in the 22% statutory rate bracket. However, that taxpayer's tax liability would be the sum of taxes 
applied to income falling within  the first three brackets, the 10%, 12%, and 22% brackets. 
Specifically,  the taxpayer would pay $987.50 (or 10%) on the first
$9,875 in taxable income, $3,630 (or 12%) on the next $30,250 in taxable income, and $2,172.50 (or 
22%) on the last
$9,875 in income. T hus, the taxpayer's total tax bill would  be $6,790 on $50,000 in taxable 
income. Even though this taxpayer is in the 22% tax bracket, their average tax rate is 13.6%.

Certain higher-income individuals  may be subject to the alternative  minimum tax (AMT). There are 
two marginal tax rates under the AMT, 26% and 28%, that are apphed to an expanded income base. The 
AMT is discussed in further detail below.

Tax dates on Capital  Gains  and Dividends
As was noted above, income earned from long-term capital gains and qualified  dividends  may be 
taxed at lower rates. The rate on long-term capital gains and qualified  dividends  can be 0%, 15%, 
or 20%, depending on the taxpayer's taxable income and filing  status. The rates are linked to the 
statutory rate brackets that were in effect before P.L. 115-97 was enacted, such that the 20% rate 
applies  to taxpayers that would have been in the 39.6% bracket (under the pre-P.L. 115-97 rate

structure). Taxpayers that would have been in the 25%, 28%, 33%, and 35% tax brackets under the 
former rate structure face a 15% tax rate on long-term capital gains and qualified  dividends, 
whereas the rate is 0% for taxpayers that would have been in the 10% and 15% tax brackets under the

Net Investment Income
Certain higher-income individuals  may be subject to an additional  3.8% tax on net investment 
income. Specifically, the tax apphes  to the lesser of(1) net investment income, or (2) the amount 
by which modified AGI exceeds fixed threshold amounts. 3^ The fixed threshold amounts are
$250,000 for taxpayers filing jointly  and $200,000 for other filers. 34 The net-investment-income
tax increases the maximum tax rate on capital gains and dividends  to 23.8%. The maximum rate on 
other investment income, including interest, annuities, royalties, and rent, is 40.8%.

Tax Credits
After a taxpayer's tax hability  has been calculated, tax credits are subtracted from gross tax 
liability  to arrive at a final tax liability  (see Figure 3). Tax credits offset tax liability on 
a dollar- for-dollar basis. There are two different types of tax credits: refundable and 
nonrefundable. If a tax credit is refundable, and the credit amount exceeds tax liability,  a 
taxpayer receives the credit (or a portion of the credit) as a refund. If credits are not 
refundable, then the credit is limited to the amount of tax liability.  In most cases, unused 
credits cannot be carried forward to offset tax hability  in future tax years. Some credits are 
phased out as income rises to limit or eliminate benefits for higher-income taxpayers.










’³ Modified AGI  is AGI increased  by the amount excluded from income as foreign earned income.
34 T he threshold amount is $1 25,000 for married taxpayers filing separate returns. These 
threshold amounts are not adjusted  for inflation.

                Overview of  the   Federal  Tax Sys tern in 2020 



Tax credits that are refundable or have a refundable portion include the earned income tax credit 
(EITC)35 and the child tax credit (CTC). 36 The American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC), a tax 
credit for tuition expenses, also has a refundable portion.3' The health insurance premium tax 
credit is another refundable credit.'8 Temporary law enacted as part of the Coronavirus Aid, 
Relief,  and Economic Security (CARES) Act (P.L. 116-136) created a one-time refundable tax 
credit—the 2020 Recovery Rebate. 3
A nonrefundable tax credit can be claimed for child and dependent care expenses. 4    There are aho 
tax credits for other purposes, such as education.4'
Tax credits add to the complexity of the tax system for various reasons. For one, tax credits can 
cause effective marginal tax rates to differ from statutory marginal tax rates for many taxpayers. 
42 For example, the earned income tax credit (EITC) phases in as income increases, reducing a 
taxpayer's marginal tax rate. At higher income levels,  as the credit phases out, the taxpayer 
faces  a higher marginal tax rate during that phaseout range. Thus, effective marginal tax rates 
can be less than or greater than statutory rates. Tax credits can also pose administrative 
challenges. 43

Alternative Minimum Tax
Individuals  may also pay tax under the alternative minimum tax (AMT). The AMT apphes  lower tax 
rates to a broader income base. The policy goal of the AMT is to prevent certain higher- income 
taxpayers from using the graduated personal income tax rate structure and tax preferences to avoid 
paying sufficient amounts of taxes.44

          Overview of  the  Federal  Tax Sys tern in 2020 



To calculate the AMT, an individual  first adds back various tax items, including certain itemized 
deductions and business tax preferences, to regular taxable income. 45 This grossed-up amount 
becomes the income base for the AMT.
The AMT exemption is subtracted from the AMT’s income base. For 2020, the AMT exemption  is 
$113,400 for married taxpayers filing a joint return, $56,700 for married taxpayers filing separate 
returns, and $72,900 for all other individual  tax filers. 46 These exemption amounts are indexed 
for inflation.  The AMT exemption  is reduced by 25% of the amount by which a taxpayer's AMT 
taxable income exceeds certain threshold amounts. In 2020, the AMT exemption amount begins to phase 
out at $1,036,800 for married taxpayers filing a joint  return and $518,400 for all other 
individual  tax filers.
A two-tiered rate structure of 26% and 28% is assessed against AMT taxable income. 47 The taxpayer 
compares his AMT tax liability  to his regular tax liability  and pays the greater of the two. Most 
nonrefundable personal tax credits are allowed against the AMT. Few taxpayers are subject to the 
individual  AMT.  For 2019, JCT estimated that roughly 200,000 tax filers paid the AMT (nearly 174 
million  return were filed).4

The  Corporate Income Tax
The corporate income tax generally only applies  to C corporations (also known as regular 
corporations). These corporations—named for Subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), which 
details their tax treatment—are generally treated as taxable entities  separate from their 
shareholders.49 That is, corporate income is taxed once at the corporate level according to the 
corporate income tax system. When corporate dividend payments are made or capital gains are 
realized,  income is taxed again at the individual-shareholder  level according to the individual  
tax system (discussed above). In contrast, noncorporate businesses, including S corporations 50  
and partnerships,5' pass their income through to owners who pay taxes. Collectively,  these 
noncorporate business entities are referred to as pass-throughs. For these types of entities, 
business income is taxed only once, at individual  income tax rates. As discussed above, taxpayers 
may be allowed to claim a 20% deduction from certain income earned by pass-through businesses.


"   For example, the income tax base for the AMT does not allow a deduction  for state and local 
taxes paid.

entity for tax purposes. S corporations are named for Subchapt er S of the IRC, which details their

and business  advantages of a C corporation with the tax advantages of a partnership. See CRS

                Overview of  the   Federal  Tax Sys tern in 2020 



The corporate income tax is designed as a tax on corporate profits (also known as net income). 
Broadly  defined, corporate profit is total income minus the cost associated with generating that 
income.52  Business expenses that may be deducted from income include employee compensations the 
decline in  value of machines, equipment, and structures (i.e., depreciation); general supplies and 
materials; advertising; and interest payments  (subject to certain limitations). 5' Businesses  may 
also be allowed  100% first-year depreciation or to expense the costs of certain property.'4 The 
corporate income tax also allows for a number of other special deductions, credits, and tax 
preferences that reduce taxes paid by corporations. Oftentimes, these provisions are intended to 
promote particular policy goals  (promoting charitable giving or encouraging investment in 
renewable energy, for example). A corporation's tax liability  can be calculated as follows:
Taxes     [(Total Income — Deductible Expenses)     Tax Rate] — Tax Credits.
Some corporations experience net operating losses (NOLs), which occur when total income less 
expenses is negative. 55  Under permanent law, losses arising after 2017 can generally be “carried 
forward” indefinitely, and used to offset future tax liability.  The NOL deduction is generahy 
limited  to 80% of taxable income. 56 Temporary law enacted as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, 
 and Economic Security (CARES) Act (P.L. 116-136) allows for NOLs generated in taxable years 
beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January  l,  2021, to be carried back for up five 
years and suspends the limit to 80% of taxable income for taxable years beginning before January 1, 
2021.5'
The corporate income tax rate is a flat 21%. Thus, tax liability  before applying  tax credits  is 
generally  calculated as 21% of taxable income. Corporate tax liability  can be reduced by claiming 
corporate tax credits. Credits claimed by corporations  include the research credit, 5' the low-

services.  Other income sources include  investment  income, royalties, rents, and capital gains.
’³ T he 2017 tax revision (P.L. 115-97) limit s interest payments, with the limitation generally 
set at 30% of adjusted taxable income. The limitation does not apply to small businesses  with 
average gross receipts of $25 million or less or to certain regulated public  utilities. Temporary 
law enacted as part of the Coronavirus Air   Relief, and Economic Security (CARES)  Act (P.L. 
116-136) relaxes the limit ation t o 50% of adjusted taxable income for tax years 2019 and 2020.

In broad economic  terms, the base of the corporate income tax is the return to equity capital. 
Income produced by corporate capital investment includes that produced by corporate investment of 
borrowed funds (debt), and that produced by investment of equity, or funds provided by 
stockholders. The deductibility of certain items makes it such that the corporate income tax apphes 
 largely  to equity capital. Specifically,  wages are tax deductible, so labor's contribution to 
corporate revenue is excluded from the corporate tax base. Additionahy,  profits from debt- 
financed investment are paid out as interest, which is partially deductible. To the extent that 
interest is deductible, the return to debt capital is excluded from the corporate tax base. Equity 
investments are financed by retained earnings and the sale of stock. The income equity  investment 
generates is paid out as dividends  and the capital gains that accrue as stock inc reases in value. 
Neither form of equity income is generally deductible. Thus, the base of the corporate income tax 
is largely the return to equity capital.
With the base of the corporate tax being largely equity income, the flow of capital out of the 
corporate sector and other economic adjustments probably cause the burden of the tax to spread to 
all owners of capital: owners of unincorporated business, bondholders, and homeowners. In analyzing 
 the incidence of the corporate tax, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and JCT generally  
distribute most of the burden to owners of capita   with a smaller portion falling  on labor 
income.64 Since owners of capital tend to be in higher income groups, and most of the corporate tax 
burden falls on capital, the corporate tax is widely viewed as being progressive.

Corporate Income Earned Abroad65
There are a number of rules governing the taxation of foreign-source income earned by U.S. 
corporations.  The United States has a quasiterritorial tax system (pure territorial tax systems 
tax only income earned within a country's borders). In general, dividends received by U.S. 
corporate shareholders  from their controlled foreign corporations (CFCs) are eligible for a 100% 
dividends- received deduction. However, certain forms of passive or easily shifted income are taxed 
in the year earned—under  subpart F. In addition, global intangible  low-taxed income (GILTI) is 
taxed at 10.5%.66 Adeduction is allowed for the foreign derived intangible  income (FDII)—roughly 
the share of intangible  income that is attributed to foreign activity.

Current law also contains a general antiabuse provision whose focus is primarily on U.S. 
subsidiaries of foreign parents, although it apphes  in general to all related parties. Unlike  
Subpart F or the GILTI provision, the base erosion and antiavoidance tax (BEAf)  is not aimed at
including  income but at disallowing deductions for certain “base erosion” payments made by U.S. 
parents to their foreign subsidiaries that historically  have been used to shift profits out of the 
United  States. BEAf  imposes a minimum tax which is equal to 10%, in 2020, of the sum of taxable 
income and base erosion payments on corporations with average annual gross receipts of at least 
$500 million  over the past three tax years and with deductions attributable to outbound payments 
exceeding 3% of overall deductions. 67

Social Insurance and Retirement Payroll Taxes
Payroll taxes are used to fund specific programs, largely Social Security and Medicare. 68  Social 
Security and Medicare taxes are generally  paid  at a combined rate of 15.3% of wages, with 7.65% 
being paid by the employee and employer alike. 69
The Social Security part of the tax, or the old age, survivors, and disability insurance (OASDI) 
tax, is 6.2% for both employees and employers (12.4% in total). 70 In 2020, the tax applies to the 
first $137,700 in wages. This wage base is adjusted annuahy for inflation.
The Medicare portion of the tax, or the Medicare hospital insurance (HI) tax, is 1.45% for both 
employees and employers (2.9% in total).'1 There is no wage cap for the HI tax (the Medicare HI tax 
applies  to all wage earnings). Certain higher-income taxpayers may be subject to an additional Hl 
tax of 0.9%. For married taxpayers filing jointly,  combined wages above $250,000 are subject to 
the additional  0.9% HI tax. 72 The threshold for single and head of household filers is $200,000. 
These threshold amounts are not indexed for inflation.
Employers may also be subject to a federal unemployment insurance payroll tax. 73  This tax is 0.6% 
on the first $7,000 of wages.74  Federal unemployment insurance payroll taxes are used to pay for 
the administrative costs of the unemployment insurance (UI) program. State UI taxes generally  pay 
for UI benefits. 75
Most taxpayers pay more in payroll taxes than income taxes. For 2020, the Tax Policy Center 
estimates that 66% of tax filing  units will have a payroll tax hability  that exceeds income tax 
hability.'6   Taxpayers closer to the top of the income distribution are more likely  to have an 
income tax liability  that exceeds payroll tax liability  (see Figure 4).

Most low- and middle-income taxpayers pay more in payroll taxes than in income taxes. 77 The 
average payroll tax rate across all taxpayers is estimated to be 6.9% for 2020. The average rate is 
higher in the middle  of the income distribution, and lower at the top of the income distribution.
The lower average payroll tax rate at the top of the income distribution  is largely  a consequence 
of the wage base limit  for the OASDI tax. Average income tax rates, in contrast, increase across

Estate and Gift Taxes
Upon death, an individual's  estate may be subject to tax.'8  The base of the federal estate tax is 
generally  property transferred at death, less allowable deductions and exemptions. An unlimited 
marital deduction is allowed for property transferred to a surviving spouse. Other allowable 
deductions include estate administration expenses and charitable bequests. The effective estate tax 
exemption  is $11.58 million  for 2020. 79 The value of the estate over the exemption amount is 
generally  taxed at a rate of 40%.  0
The federal gift tax operates alongside the estate tax to prevent individuals  from avoiding the 
estate tax by transferring property to heirs before dying. For 2020, the first $15,000 of gifts 
from one individual  to another is excluded from taxation and does not apply to the lifetime
exemption.  l  Any amount over this annual exclusion lowers the effective lifetime estate tax 
exemption.
The gift tax and estate tax are unified in  that the same lifetime  exemption amount apphes  to 
both taxes ($11.58 million  in 2020). Being  unified, taxable gifts reduce the exemption amount 
that is available  for estate tax purposes. The gift tax rate is 40%, the same as the top rate for 
the estate tax, for gifts beyond the exemption amount.
Few taxpayers pay the estate tax. Through 2025, an estimated 0.06% of decedents will pay the estate 
tax.'2 The estate tax is also progressive, up to the very top of the income distribution.  For 
taxpayers in the 95'h to 99th percentile, the estate tax has been estimated to be 0. 2% of cash 
income in 2020.    For taxpayers in the top 1% and top 0.1% of the income distribution,  the estate 
tax has been estimated to be 0.3% of cash income in 2020.

Excise Taxes
Excise taxes are levied  on the consumption of goods and services rather than income. Unlike  sales 
taxes, they apply to particular commodities,  rather than to broad categories. Historically, the 
federal government has levied excise taxes, but not a broad-based sales tax, instead leaving sales 
taxes to the states as a revenue source.

Gravelle.

he exemption amount is indexed for inflation   in $1,000 increments.

                Overview of  the   Federal  Tax Sys tern in 2020 



Federal excise taxes are levied on a variety of products. The collection point of the tax varies 
across products. For some goods, taxes are collected at the production level. Other excise taxes 
are collected on retail sales. In terms of receipts, the single largest tax is the excise tax on 
gasoline.  4  Other prominent excise taxes are those on diesel and other fuels; trucks, trailers, 
and tractors; aviation-related taxes and fees;  5  excise taxes on beer, wine, and distilled 
spirits; 86  taxes on tobacco products; Affordable Care Act (ACA)  taxes and fees'7 (e.g., 
insurance provider fee," branded pharmaceuticals fee); and taxes on firearms and ammunition.
Most federal excise taxes are paid into federal trust funds devoted to specific federal activities, 
as opposed to remaining in the federal budget’s general fund. Estimates for 2020 indicate that of 
the
$95 billion  in anticipated excise tax revenue, approximately  68% will support trust funds, with 
the remainder being general fund revenue. 90 The largest trust fund is the Highway Trust Fund. 
Devoted revenue sources include excise taxes on fuels, trucks, and tires. Aviation-related excise 
taxes support the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, the second-largest of the excise-tax-supported 
trust funds.  ' General fund excise taxes include taxes on alcohol and tobacco and ACA-related 
excise taxes.
Excise taxes can result in consumers paying higher prices for goods and services. Overall, 
households from the lower part of the income distribution tend to pay a larger share of their 
income in excise taxes than higher-income households.  2  Thus, taken as a whole, federal excise 
taxes are generally  believed  to be regressive. The degree of regressivity can vary for different 
types of excise taxes. For example, tobacco excise taxes are estimated to be more regressive than 
aviation-related excise taxes. 9'

Taxes as a Share of the  Economy
Federal revenues are derived from several sources and have collectively ranged from roughly 
one-fifth to one-seventh the size of the economy. Figure 5 displays total federal tax revenues and
major sources of federal tax revenue as percentages of gross domestic product (GDP) since 1945.

                Overview of  the   Federal  Tax Sys tern in 2020 



For 2019, it was estimated that revenues would be 16.7% of GDP, slightly below the post-World War 
II average of 17.2% of GDP.
Since the mid-1940s, the individual  income tax has been the largest single source of federal 
revenue (business income may also be taxed under the individual  income tax system, as previously 
discussed in “The Individual Income Tax”). Between 2000 and 2010, however, the individual  income 
tax receipts decreased relative to the size of the economy, falling from nearly 10% of GDP in 2000 
to just over 6% in 2010. Individual  income tax receipts have subsequently increased to 8% of GDP 
in 2019. Over time, the corporate income tax has fallen from the second- to the third-largest 
source of revenue. In the late 1960s, corporate taxes were replaced by social insurance and 
retirement taxes as the second-leading revenue source. Corporate receipts as a share of GDP have 
fallen  further in recent years. Excise taxes have also decreased as a share of GDP over time.

Composition of Tax Revenue
The changing shares of federal revenues over time are more clearly shown in Figure 6. For example, 
the corporate income tax accounted for roughly 28% of federal revenue in 1949, but less than 7% in 
2019.  4  Excise tax revenue was roughly 3% of federal receipts in 2019, down from 19% in 1949. In 
contrast, receipts for social insurance and retirement taxes have risen post-

The Distribution of the Tax Burden
The U.S. individual  income tax system is generally  progressive. As shown in Figure 7, taxpayers 
with lower incomes tend to have a proportionally smaller share of the overah individual  income tax 
burden. JCT projections indicate that in 2019, taxpayers in lower income categories, on average, 
had a negative share of individual  income taxes.    Thus, on average, these groups receive more in 
refundable tax benefits than they pay in federal individual  income taxes. 96  For taxpayers in 
income groups above $200,000, projections for 2019 show that their share of taxes paid exceeds 
their share of income earned. About 50% of taxpayers fall into an income category below
$50,000. In contrast, just over 7% of filers fall into an income category above $200,000. Since 
higher-income taxpayers pay a larger share of income taxes relative to their share of income, the

system is generally progressive, and causes after-tax income to be more equally distributed than 
before-tax income.
The tax system as a whole is progressive, but not as progressive as the individual income tax 
system. Payroll taxes and excise taxes tend to be regressive, with higher average tax rates paid by 
taxpayers in lower income groups. Thus, taken together in evaluating the federal tax system as a 
whole, payroll taxes and excise taxes offset some of the progressivity of the individual  income

International Comparisons
How the U.S. tax system compares to those in other countries is a perennial tax policy question. 
Figure 8 shows revenue as a percentage of GDP for OECD countries. The average over the 1987- 2018 
time period is shown, inside the band illustrating  the high and low for the period. Total U.S. 
taxes as a percentage of GDP have historically  been below the average for OECD countries.
Four countries have tended to have lower taxes as a percentage of GDP than the United States,
with most others tending to have higher taxes relative to the size of the economy. Note that such a 
direct comparison can be difficult to interpret, as it does not take into account government 
spending that reflects each country's policy preferences or deficit/surplus levels that provide 
more context.

”  T he relatively low level of revenue collections in the United States may be  part ially 
explained by  the lack of a federal-level  consumption tax (like a Value-Added  T ax), which is a 
feature of the other countries’ tax systems. Similarly,  the level of government spending may be  
partially explained by the lack  of federal provision of heal th care that occurs in the other G-7

                Overview of  the   Federal  Tax Sys tern in 2020 



Concluding Remarks
The U.S. federal tax system in 2020 looks substantively different than it did in 2017. The changes 
enacted in P.L. 115-97 affected most parts of the tax system. Over the longer term, as tax pohcies 
that were temporary in P.L. 115-97 expire, and delayed tax policies  begin to phase in, Congress 
may choose to consider whether expirations,  phase-ins, or other delayed pohcies in P.L. 115-97 
should be modified.
This report provides an overview of the federal tax system, as in effect in 2020. Information on 
taxes relative to the size of the economy, the distribution of the tax burden, and how the U.S. tax 
system compares to tax systems globally may provide context for consideration of future tax policy 
changes.
