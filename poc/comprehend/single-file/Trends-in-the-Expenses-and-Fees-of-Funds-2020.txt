Profile of Mutual Fund Shareholders, 2020
Daniel Schross, economist, and Michael  Bogdon, associate economist, prepared  this report.

Introduction
Ownership  of mutual funds  by US households  grew significantly  in the 1980s and 1990s and has
remained  steady  over  the past two  decades. 0n  average since 1999, household  ownership  of
mutual funds has  been about  45 percent each  year; this is down a bit  from  49 percent in 2001
but higher than the 41 perCent  rate in 1998. Between  mid -2000 and mid-2020, assets  held in
mutual funds increased  from $7.1 trillion to $21.4 trillion.1 In 2020, 45.7  percent of US
households  owned  mutual funds, representing 102.5  million individual mutual fund shareholders.*
Mutual fund holdings represent  a significant  component  of the  savings and investments  of many
US  households, with mutual fund assets  now accounting for  about one-fifth of households'
financial assets.3


Annual Survey
The Investment  Company Institute (ICI) conducts  an annual survey to  track US  households’
ownership  of mutual funds and to  gather information  on their  demographic  and financial
charaCteristics. The  most recent survey  was conducted  from May to  June 2020  and was based  on
a dual-frame  telephone  sample  of 3,001 randomly  selected  US households. Of these, 1,350
households were from  a landline  random  digit dial (RDD) frame, and 1,651 households  were from a
cell phone RDD frame. Of the households  contacted, 1,372 (45.7  percent) owned  mutual funds.
Eligible households  were those owning mutual funds inside or outside  employer-sponsored
retirement   plans, including funds purchased  through investment  professionals  or directly  from
 mutual fund companies  or discount  brokers. All interviews  were conducted  with the investment
decisionmaker,  the  person  most knowledgeable  about the household's  savings  and investments.‘

The “Typical” Mutual Fund—0wning Household
This report summarizes the findings of the 2020 survey.*  As described  in the first chapter, in
2020 the “typical”  mutual fund—owning  head of household

was middle-aged, employed, educated, married or living with a partner;
»   shared  investment  decisionmaking with his or her spouse or partner;
»   had $105,000  in household  income and $300,000 in household financial assets;
»   owned  investments  other than mutual funds, including individual stocks, and had more than
half of the household's  financial assets (excluding the primary residence) invested in mutual
funds;
had $126,700  invested  in four mutual funds, including at least one equity fund;
»   owned  mutual funds inside an employer-sponsored retirement  plan, such as a 401(k) plan,
403(b) plan, 457 plan, SEP IRA, SAR-SEP  IRA, or SIMPLE IRA;
owned  mutual funds outside employer-sponsored retirement  plans, primarily  purchased through
investment  professionals  (e.g., registered  investment advisers, full-service  brokers,
independent financial planners, bank or savings institution representatives, insurance  agents, or
accountants);
»   owned a traditional or Roth IRA; and
»   was confident that mutual funds could help him or her reach financial goals.

Chapter 1 discusses  a full set of figures  highlighting demographiC  and finanCial characteristics
of mutual fund—owning  households, the variety  of mutual funds they own, and the different ways
they purchase  mutual funds, as well as their financial assets, financial goals, and  willingness
to take investment  risk. The  remaining chapters  present similar  information  for subgroups of
mutual fund— owning households. Figures  for  all  of the chapters  are available  in a Microsoft
Excel file located at www.ici.org/info/20  rpt_profifes_data20.xls.

Variations in Characteristics of Households That Own Mutual Funds
Chapters  2, 3, and  4 focus  on the  prinCipal channels  used  by  mutual fund—owning households
to purchase  fund shares. With the growth  of 401(k) plans since 1990, employer-sponsored
retirement plans have  become a common  channel through  which  households  own  mutual funds. In
2020,
83 percent of mutual fund—owning  households  held funds through these plans. Sixty-three  percent
of mutual fund—owning  households  held mutual funds  purchased  outside  employer-sponsored
retirement plans. Nearly  half of mutual fund—owning  households  held mutual funds purchased  from
the sales force channel, that is, through investment  professionals, which  include  registered

2020

investment  advisers, fuII-service  brokers, independent  financial planners, bank or savings
institution  representatives, insurance agents, and accountants. Thirty-one  percent  owned fund
shares purchased  from the  direCt market channel, which  consists  of purchases  made  directly
from fund companies  and through discount  brokers. More than  half of mutual fund—owning
households held mutual funds through  multiple sources.^  In identifying their  primary source for
purchasing funds, 59 percent of mutual fund—owning  households  pointed to employer-sponsored
retirement plans, 29 percent  reported the sales force  channel, and 12 percent cited the direct
market channel.

Chapter  5 presents mutual fund—owning households by generation. Thirty percent  were members of
Generation  Z and the Millennial Generation (born between 1981 and 2012), and 31 percent  were
members of Generation  X (born between 1965 and 1980).’ The Baby Boom Generation (those
born between 1946 and 1964) represented  a 31 percent share of mutual fund—owning households. Eight
percent were members of the Silent and GI Generations (born between 1904 and 1945)   Figures in
this chapter highlight how demographic  characteristics, mutual fund ownership, financial assets,
and savings goals vary among mutual fund—owning households by generation.

Chapter  6 describes  mutual fund—owning  households  by age. Twenty  percent of individuals
heading households  owning mutual funds were younger  than 35. The largest age group  consisted of
individuals  between  the ages of 35  and 54, who  made up 39 percent  of mutual fund—owning
household  heads. Household  heads aged  55 to  64 aCCounted  for  21  percent of mutual
fund—owning households. The  remaining 20 percent of individuals  heading mutual fund—owning
households  were 65  or older. Figures  in this chapter  reveal how demographic  characteristics,
mutual fund ownership, financial assets, and savings goals vary among mutual fund —owning
households  by age group.

Chapter  7 describes  mutual fund—owning  households  by their level of household  income.
Twelve  percent of mutual fund—owning  households  had  incomes  below  $50,000, 31 percent  had
incomes  between  $50,000  and $99,999, 24 percent  had  incomes  between  $100,000  and $149,999,
and 33  percent  had  incomes  of $150,000  or more. Figures  in this chapter focus on how
demographic CharaCteristics, mutual fund ownership, financial assets, and savings goals vary among
mutual fund—owning  households  by  household  income.


















I t I RES EARtH RE P ORT: PRO FI LE 0F MUTUAL FU ND SHAREH 0 LDERS,  2020 //  3

Chapter  8 examines mutual fund—owning households  by household  financial assets.
Fourteen percent of mutual fund—owning households had financial assets of less than $50,000, 10
percent had assets between  $50,000 and $99,999, 20 percent had assets between  $100,000 and
$249,999, and 56 percent had assets of $250,000 or more. Figures in this chapter show how
demographic  characteristics, mutual fund ownership, financial assets, and savings goals vary among
mutual fund—owning households  by household  financial assets.

Chapter  9 examines  mutual fund—owning  households  by the  level of investment  risk respondents
are willing to take. Forty percent of mutual fund—owning households were willing to take
above-average  or substantial investment risk for similar levels of financial gain, 42 perCent were
willing to take average investment risk for average financial gain, and 18 percent were willing to
take below-average  investment risk for below-average financial gain or were unwilling to take
investment risk. Figures in this chapter illustrate how demographic characteristics, mutual fund
ownership, financial assets, and savings goals vary among mutual fund—owning households  by level
of investment risk.

Chapter 10 describes  mutual fund—owning  households  by the year  of their  initial mutual fund
purchase. Twenty-two  percent of mutual fund—owning  households  purchased  their first mutual
fund before 1990, and 29 percent  purchased  their first mutual fund between  1990 and 1999.
Twenty-five  percent  purchased  their first mutual fund between  2000 and 2009, and 24 perCent
did so in 2010 or later. Figures  in this chapter  highlight  how demographic  characteristics,
mutual fund ownership, financial assets, and savings goals vary among mutual fund—owning
households  by year of  initial mutual fund purchase.

Taken together, these chapters present an overview of the millions of US households that invest in
mutual funds, the ways in which they purchase fund shares, and the ways in which they use funds to
meet their current and long-term financial needs.

CHAPTER 1
Mutual Fund—Owning Households

In 2020, 58.7 million, or 45.7 percent of, US households  owned  mutual funds (Figure 1.1). The
median age of individuals heading households that owned  mutual funds was 50 (Figure 1.2).* More
than half ofthese indvduats had cokege or postg aduate degrees. SXty-nine percentofUS
househotdsthat owned  mutual funds consisted  of couples  who were married or living with a
partner, and investment decisionmaking was a shared  responsibility in 53 percent of mutual
fund-owning households.

The majority  of the heads of mutual fund—owning households  were employed  and earned  moderate,
although above-average, household incomes. In 2020, 75  percent of individuals  heading households
that owned  mutual funds were employed  full- or part-time (Figure 1.3). Four percent of
individuals heading households  that owned  mutual funds indicated that they were retired from
their lifetime occupations  but were employed either full- or part-time. Twenty-five  percent of
individuals  heading households  that owned  mutual funds were not employed,  but 76 percent  of
these household  heads were retired. All told, 23  percent  of individuals  heading households
that owned  mutual funds were retired from their lifetime occupations. The median  income of mutual
fund—owning  households  was
$105,000. Twelve percent had household  incomes of less than $50,000, 15 percent had household
incomes between $50,000 and $74,999, 16 percent had household  incomes between $75,000 and
$99,999, and 57 percent had household  incomes of $100,000  or more.

Financial Characteristics
The  majority of mutual fund—owning  households  have accumulated  a variety  of financial assets
and retirement accounts. Among households that owned  mutual funds, median  household financial
assets  were $300,000 (Figure 1.4). Mutual fund—owning  households  typically  had  other types  of
savings and investments. Twenty-four  percent owned  certificates  of deposit, 48 percent owned
individual stocks, and 12  percent owned  individual bonds (excluding US savings  bonds). In
addition, 32  percent  held investment  real estate, and  24 percent held fixed or variable
annuities.
A significant  number  of mutual fund—owning  households  made use  of tax-advantaged savings
vehicles. Eighty-eight  percent had assets  in employer-sponsored retirement  plan amounts, usually
401(k) plans, and 65  percent owned  individual retirement amounts (IR As).1^ Twenty  percent  of
US households  owning mutual funds had education-targeted savings  program  accounts—7  percent
had Coverdell education savings aCcounts (ESAs), and 17 percent  had  529  plan  accounts.

2020



Equity mutual funds were the most commonly held mutual funds. Among households that owned mutual
funds, median mutual fund holdings were $126,700 (Figure 1.5). The largest percentage   of mutual
fund—owning households, 90 percent, owned  equity funds. Thirty-five percent had
invested  in balanced funds,11  43 percent in bond funds, and 53 percent in money market funds. In
addition, 36 percent of mutual fund—owning households  held global or international equity funds.
Mutual fund holdings represented  more than half of household  financial assets for 56 percent of
households that owned  mutual funds.

The majority of mutual fund—owning households  were longtime mutual fund investors (Figure 1.5).
Twenty-two  percent reported that the household  bought its first mutual fund before 1990,
29 percent between 1990 and 1999, and 25 percent between 2000 and 2009. Twenty-four  percent
reported that the household  bought its first fund in 2010 or later.

Mutual fund—owning households  owned many funds through multiple purchase sources (Figure 1.6). In
2020, these households  owned a median of four mutual funds. Forty-eight  percent owned three or
fewer funds, and 52 percent owned  four or more. Among households that owned funds outside
employer-sponsored retirement plans, 31 percent owned funds purchased  from one source,
36 percent owned  funds purchased  from two sources, and 33 percent owned funds purchased  from
three or more sources.

Thirty-seven  percent  of mutual fund—owning  households  held mutual funds solely inside
employer-sponsored retirement  plans, which  include  defined  contribution (DC) plans (such as
401(k), 403(b), or  457  plans) and  employer-sponsored IR As (SEP IR As, SAR-SEP  IR As, and
SIMPLE
IR As); 17 perCent  owned  funds solely  outside these plans; and  46 percent  had  funds both
inside and outside employer-sponsored retirement  plans (Figure  1.7). Altogether, 83  percent of
mutual fund— owning households  owned funds through employer-sponsored retirement  plans, and 63
percent owned funds outside these plans through  either the sales force or direct  market channels.
Nearly half of mutual fund—owning households  owned funds through the sales force channel, that is,
through investment  professionals, which  include  registered  investment  advisers, fuII-service
brokers, independent  finanCial planners, ban k or savings  institution  representatives, insurance
agents, and  accountants. Thirty-one  percent  owned funds through the  direct market channel,
which includes  mutual fund companies  directly  and discount  brokers.

Fifty-nine percent of all US households that owned  mutual funds reported that employer-sponsored
retirement plans were their primary sourC9 for purchasing mutual funds, 29 percent regarded the
sales force channel as their primary source, and 12 percent considered the direct market channel to
be their  primary source (Figure 1.7). Sixty-three percent of mutual fund—owning households in 2020
reported that the household  bought its first fund through an employer-sponsored retirement  plan.

In 2020, the vast majority  of mutual fund—owning  households  were using mutual funds to save for
retirement (Figure 1.8). Ninety-four  percent of mutual fund—owning  households  indicated that
saving for retirement  was one of their household's  financial goals, and 75  percent  indicated
that retirement saving was their primary financial goal. Eighty-three  percent of households
owning mutual funds held funds in employer-sponsored retirement  plans, and  46 percent owned
funds inside IR As.
Eighty-eight  percent  were confident that mutual funds were an investment  that could help them
meet their household's financial goals.

Views on Investment Risk
Willingness  to take investment  risk is higher  among mutual fund —owning households than  among
non-owning households.12  Almost  all  mutual fund —owning households  were willing to take some
investment  risk for  financial gain (Figure 1.9). Forty percent of mutual fund—owning  households
said they were willing to take substantial or above-average  investment  risk for  similar  levels
of financial gain. Forty-two  percent of mutual fund—owning  households  were willing to take
average  risk for average gain. Only 18 percent of mutual fund—owning  households  were willing to
take below-average risk for  below-average  gain  or were unwilling to take any investment  risk.

CHAPTER  2
Mutual Fund—Owning Households by Fund Ownership Inside and Outside Employer-Sponsored Retirement
Plans
In  2020, 83  percent  of mutual fund—owning  households  in the  United States  held  mutual funds
inside employer-sponsored retirement  plan amounts  (Figure  2.1), which  include  DC  plans (such
as 401(k),  403(b), or  457  plans) and  employer-sponsored IR As (SEP IR As, SAR-SEP  IR As, and
SIMPLE
IR As). Sixty-three  percent  of mutual fund—owning  households  owned  mutual funds  outside
employer-sponsored retirement  plan accounts,  purchased  either through the sales  force channel
(investment  professionals) or through the direct  market  channel. Forty-six  percent  of mutual
fund— owning households  owned funds  both  inside and  outside  employer-sponsored retirement
plans.

The remaining figures for this chapter show how mutual fund—owning households'  demographic and
financial characteristics, pattern of mutual fund ownership, financial assets, financial goals, and
willingness  to take risk vary by whether the mutual fund—owning households held mutual funds
inside or outside  employer-sponsored retirement  plans (see Figures 2.2 to 2.9, available in a
Microsoft Excel file located at www.ici.org/info/20_rpt_profifes_data20.xls)

CHAPTER 3
Mutual Fund—Owning  Households  by Channels Used to  PurChase Mutual Funds Outside
Employer-Sponsored Retirement Plans
Mutual fund—owning  households  gain  access  to  mutual funds through  a variety  of channels. In
2020, 83  percent  of  mutual fund—owning  households  held  mutual funds through
employer-sponsored retirement  plans, and  63  percent  owned  mutual funds  outside  such  plans
(Figure  3.1). This  fatter group  purchased  funds through  two sources: the  safes  force channel
(investment  professionals)
and the  direct  market  channel. The  sales  force channel includes  registered  investment
advisers, fu II-service  brokers, independent  financial  planners, bank  or  savings  institution
representatives,
insurance agents, and aaountants. The  direct  market channel  includes  fund companies  and
discount brokers. In  2020, nearly  half of households  owning mutual funds  held funds  purchased
through the sales  force  channel, and 31 percent  owned funds  purchased  through the direct
market  channel.

The  remaining figures for  this chapter  illustrate  how  mutual fund—owning  households'
demographic and  financial characteristics, pattern  of mutual fund  ownership,  financial assets,
financial goals,  and  willingness  to take risk vary  by  purchase  channel (see  Figures  3.2  to
 3.9, available  in a Microsoft Excel file located  at www.ici.org/

CHAPTER  4
Mutual Fund—Owning Households  by Primary SourCe for PurChasing Funds
In  2020, 59  percent  of mutual fund—owning  households  considered  employer-sponsored retirement
plans to  be their  primary  source for  purchasing mutual funds (Figure  4.1). Another  29
percent viewed the  sales  force  channel (investment  professionals) as their  main source for
buying funds—12  percent considered  full-service  brokers to  be their  primary  fund  source; 8
percent, independent  financial planners;  6  percent, bank or  savings  institution
representatives; 2  percent, insurance  agents; and
1 percent, accountants.*3  Finally, 12  percent  of mutual fund—owning  households  viewed  the
direct market channel as their  main  source for  buying funds (5  percent  indicated  fund
companies  as their primary  source, and  7  percent  cited  discount  brokers).

The  remaining figures for  this chapter  demonstrate  how  mutual fund—owning  households'
demographic  and  financial characteristics, pattern  of mutual fund  ownership,  financial assets,
financial goals, and willingness  to take risk vary  by primary  purchase  channel (see Figures
4.2 to  4.9, available  in a Microsoft  Excel file located  at

CHAPTER 5

Mutual Fund—Owning  Households  by Generation
Americans across all generations  own mutual funds. In 2020, 30 percent of individuals heading
households that owned  mutual funds were members of Generation  Z and the Millennial Generation,
who were born between 1981 and 2012 and were 39 or younger at the time of the survey
(Figure 5.1).1‘ Thirty-one percent were members of Generation  X, those born between 1965 and 1980
and aged 40 to 55 at the time of the survey. The Baby Boom Generation—who were born between 1946
and 1964 and were between 56 and 74 at the time of the survey—were  an additional 31 percent of
individuals  heading mutual fund—owning households. The remaining 8 percent of individuals heading
mutual fund—owning households  were members of the Silent and GI Generations, born between 1904 and
1945, who were 75 or older at the time of the survey.1*

Older generations held the majority of household mutual fund assets (Figure 5.1). In 2020, the Baby
Boom Generation  held 43 percent of total household mutual fund assets, and the Silent and GI
Generations held an additional 10 percent. Generation X held 31 percent of total household mutual
fund assets, and Generation  Z and Millennials held the remaining 16 percent.

CHAPTER 6
Mutual Fund—Owning  Households by Age
Households  across all  age groups own mutual funds. In 2020, 20 percent of individuals heading
households that owned  mutual funds were younger than 35 at the time of the survey (Figure 6.1).
The largest age group was composed of individuals between 35 and 54, who were 39 percent of mutual
fund—owning household  heads. Twenty-one  percent of individuals heading households that owned
mutual funds were between the ages of 55 and 64. The remaining 20 percent  were 65 or older at the
time of the survey.

Older  age groups  held  more than  half of household  mutual fund  assets (Figure  6.1). In 2020,
25  percent  of total household  mutual fund  assets  were  held  by  households  headed  by
individuals between  the  ages  of  55  and  64. Twenty-nine  percent  were  held  by households
whose  heads  were  65 or  older. Households  headed  by individuals  aged 35 to  54  held the
largest amount  of mutual fund assets, 39  perCent. The  remaining 7  percent  was  held  by
households  whose  heads were  younger than 35.

The  remaining figures for  this chapter  reveal how  mutual fund—owning  households'  demographic
and financial characteristics, pattern  of mutual fund  ownership,  financial assets, financial
goals, and willingness  to take risk vary  by age group (see Figures  6.2 to  6.9, available  in a

CHAPTER 7
Mutual Fund—Owning  Households  by
Household  Income
Households  in  all  income  categories  own  mutual funds. In  2020, 12  percent  of  mutual
fund—owning households  had  incomes  of  less than  $50,000, 31 percent  had  household  incomes
between  $50,000 and $99,999,  24 percent  had  household  incomes  between  $100,000  and
$149,999, and 33  percent had  household  incomes  of $150,000  or  more (Figure  7.1).1^ The
median  household  income  of  mutual fund—owning  households  ($105,000)  was  more than the
median  household  income  nationwide
(   68,703),*7  reflecting their  older  age, higher  education, and  higher  likelihood  of
full-time employment,  on  average.

The remaining figures for this chapter establish how mutual fund—owning households'  demographic
and financial characteristics, pattern of mutual fund ownership, financial assets, financial goals,
 and willingness  to take risk vary by household  income (see Figures 7.2 to 7.9, available in a

CHAPTER 8
Mutual Fund—Owning  Households  by Household Financial Assets
Mutual fund—owning households  represent  a  range  of levels  of  household  financial assets. In
2020, 14  percent  of mutual fund—owning  households  in the  United States  had  household
financial assets  of less than $50,000, and 10 percent  had household  financial assets  between
$50,000  and  $99,999 (Figure  8.1). Another  20  percent  had  household  financial assets
between  $100,000  and $249,999,  and 56 perCent  had  household  financial assets of  $250,000  or
 more. Household  financial assets  include assets in  employer-sponsored retirement  plans but
exclude the  household’s  primary  residenCe.

The  remaining figures  for this chapter  demonstrate  how  mutual fund—owning  households'
demographic  and  financial characteristics, pattern  of mutual fund  ownership,  financial assets,
finanCial goals, and willingness  to take risk vary  by household  finanCial assets (see  Figures

CHAPTER 9
Mutual Fund—Owning  Households  by Investment Risk ToleranCe
Mutual fund—owning households generally indicate willingness to take financial risk. In 2020,
40 percent of mutual fund—owning households  in the United States were willing to take substantial
or above-average  risk for similar levels of financial gain (Figure 9.1). Those willing to take
average risk for average financial gain—the largest group—accounted for 42 percent of all mutual
fund— owning households. Eighteen  percent of mutual fund—owning households  described themselves
as willing to take below-average  risk for below-average  financial gain or unwilling to take any
investment risk.

The  remaining figures  for this chapter  show  how  mutual fund—owning  households'  demographic
and finanCial CharaCteristics, pattern  of mutual fund ownership, finanCial assets, and financial
goals  vary  by investment  risk tolerance  (see Figures  9.2 to  9.9, available  in a Microsoft
EXC9I file located  at www.ici.org/info/20_rpt_profiles   data 20.xis).

CHAPTER 10
Mutual Fund—Owning  Households  by Year of Initial Mutual Fund PurChase
Most mutual fund—owning  households  have invested  in mutual funds for  many years. In 2020, 22
percent  of mutual fund—owning  households  reported that the household  purchased  their first
mutual fund  before 1990; 29  percent  purchased  their first  mutual fund  between 1990 and 1999;
and  25  percent  purchased  their first mutual fund between  2000 and  2009 (Figure  10.1).
Twenty-four  percent of mutual fund—owning  households  purchased  their first mutual fund in 2010
or later.

The remaining figures for this chapter  illustrate how mutual fund—owning households'  demographic
and fnandat characteristics, pattern ofmutuatfund owne shp, fnandatassets,fnancatgoats, and
willingness  to take risk vary by year of initial mutual fund purchase (see Figures 10.   to 10.9,

APPENDIX
Research Methodology
Research Design
Kantar TNS, a nationwide  opinion  research  firm, conducted the survey of mutual fund—owning
households under the direction of the Investment Company Institute's Research  Department. The
survey gathered demographic, financial, and fund ownership characteristics of mutual fund—owning
households  nationwide. The survey collected  information on fund ownership  inside and outside
employer-sponsored retirement plans, including the number  and types of funds owned  and total
mutual fund assets. The survey also gathered data about aspects of fund investing, including
financial goals and willingness to take investment risk. Finally, the survey collected  information
on household  income and demographic  data such as the age, education, and marital status of the
head of household.

Interviewing
ICI conducts the Annual Mutual Fund Shareholder  Tracking Survey  each year to  gather  information
on the demographic  and financial characteristics of mutual fund—owning  households  in the  United
States. The most recent survey  was conducted  from May to  June  2020 and  was  based on
a dual-frame  telephone sample  of 3,001 US  households. Of these, 1,350  households  were from a
landline  random  digit dial (RDD) frame, and 1,651 households  were from  a Cell phone  RDD frame.
0f  the households  contacted, 1,372 (45.7  percent) owned  mutual funds. API interviews  were
conducted  over  the telephone  with the member  of the  household  who was either the sole or the
co-decisionmaker most knowledgeable  about the household’s savings  and investments.

Revisions to  lCl's Annual Mutual Fund Shareholder Tracl‹ing Survey
In the usual course of household  survey work, researchers  periodically reexamine  sampling and
weighting methods to ensure that the results published are representative of the underlying
population  of interest. ICI reexamined  its Annual Mutual Fund Shareholder Tracking Survey in
2014, and the figures presented  in this paper for the 2020 survey reflect a revised sampling and
weighting methodology that was adopted  in 2014. To achieve a representative sample of US
households, the 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 Annual Mutual Fund Shareholder Tracking Surveys
were based on
a duatfamesampte ottandine (abouthaf)and cet phone numbers(abouthaf).The combined sample for  2019
and  2020 includes  about  45  percent of households  reached  on a landline  and  about 55
percent of households  reached  on a cell phone. Before 2014, the  Annual Mutual Fund  Shareholder
Tracking Survey  was based  on a sample  of land line phone  numbers. The change to  a combined
sample  of cell and  landline  phone  numbers  improves the  representativeness of the sample. For

a detailed description  of the survey methodology,  see “Ownership  of Mutual Funds, Shareholder
Sentiment,  and Use of the Internet, 2020,”  /C/ Research  Perspective  26, no. 8 (November),
available  at www.ici.org/pdf/per26-08.pdf.

Survey Weights
When a survey sample is drawn from a population, the proportions  of segments  within the sample
(by age, income, or other  key variables)  may  not  match the distribution  of those segments
within the population. The sample's  distribution  may  be different  due to  sampling techniques,
varying degrees of  nonresponse  from segments  of the population, or a survey design that was not
able to  cover the entire popu lation. It is possible  to  improve the  relation  between  the
sample  and the  population   from  which  it  was drawn  by applying weights to  the sample that
match the  proportions  present
in the popu lation. This  process  is known  as sample-balancing, or raking.*8  Because the  sample
methodology  for the Annual Mutual Fund Shareholder  TraCking Survey  is a dual-frame  RDD survey
including cell phones, it  was  necessary to  adjust the  weighting methodology  for the survey. In
order to  combine the  landline  and cell phone samples, an initial base weight was created to
adjust for households that could  have been  in both the  landline  and cell phone  sample frames.
A second  stage of weighting included the standard  raking to  control totals based on census
region, householder  age, household  income, and  educational attainment  of the head of household
from the most recent version  of the Annual Social and EconomiC  SUpplement (ASEC) to  the
Current  Population  Survey (CPS).1   In the  2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and  2020 survey,
the  second  stage of weighting  also  included  raking to  control totals  based  on household
telephone  status  from the  most recent version  of the National Health Interview  Survey
(NHIS).*° The weighting adjusts for  differences  among the  households sampled  in the ICI  survey
and the population  of US households.

Sampling Error
The  use of sample  surveys is standard  practice  for  constructing estimates  about a total
population. Estimates  derived through survey sampling are subject to sampling error. As sample
size increases, the level of potential sampling error generally  becomes  smaller. The overall
margin  of sampling error for the  2020 sample  of households  owning mutual funds is +  2.6
percentage  points at the 95  percent confidence  level. Components  may  not  add to  100 percent
because  of rounding; where  respondents were allowed to  provide  multiple responses,  percentages
 may add to  more than 100 percent.

Tabu Nations  of Investment Company Institute data indicate that total net assets in mutual funds
for  june 2000 were $7,113  billion. More specifically, in  june 2000, equity mutual funds held
$4,292 billion; hybrid mutual funds held $362 billion; bond mutual funds held $801 billion; and
money market mutual funds held
$1,658  billion. Total net assets in mutual funds for  june 2020 were $21,411 billion—equity mutual
funds held
$10,609 billion; hybrid mutual funds held $1,450  billion; bond mutual funds held $4,718  billion;
and money market funds held $4,635  billion. See Investment Company Institute 2020a.

See Figure 10 in Holden, Schrass, and Bogdan  2020b.
7   Survey participants  must be 18 or older and be the most knowledgeable  about the household’s
savings and investments; so, although people  born between 1981 and 2012 are members  of the
Miltenniaf  Generation (1981 to 1996) and Generation Z (1997 to 2012), only those born between 1981
and 2002 are included in  this survey. The majority of this grouping is the Millenniaf  Generation;
Generation Z represents  3 percent of individuals  heading mutual fund—owning households  in 2020.
8   The majority of this grouping is the Silent Generation. The GI Generation, which includes
individuals  born between 1904 and 1927, represented  tess than 0.5  percent of individuals heading
mutual fund—owning households  in 2020.
9 Throughout  this report, head of household  refers to the survey respondent who identified
themselves  as the sole or co-decisionmaker for household saving and investing.
10  IR As include traditional IR As, Roth IR As, and employer-sponsored IR As (SEP IR As, SAR-SEP
IR As, and SIMPLE IR As). For additional information  on IRA-owning households, see Holden  and
Schrass  2021a. For detailed analysis  of IRA investors' account balances; asset allocation; and
contribution, rollover, conversion, and withdrawal activities, see Holden  and Bass 2018 and Holden
 and Schrass  2018.
11 Balanced funds, also called hybrid funds, invest in a mix of equities and fixed-income
securities. Most target date and lifestyle mutual funds are counted in this category.
12 See Figure 11 in Holden, Schrass, and Bogdan  2020a. In 2020, 40 percent of mutual fund—owning
households were willing to take above-average  or substantial investment  risk, compared  with 12
percent of households not owning mutual funds.
13 The sample sizes for mutual fund—owning households that consider  either insurance  agents or
accountants to be their  primary source for purchasing mutual funds were too small to analyze. Th
us, Figures 4.2 to 4.9 do not report separate data for those households.
14  Survey participants  must be 18 or older and be the most knowledgeable  about the household's
savings and investments; so, although people  born between 1981 and 2012 are members  of the
